## Inexact Catching-Up Algorithm for Sweeping Processes

This repository contains numerical results from our study on the inexact catching-up algorithm for sweeping processes, as presented in the paper arXiv:2501.04781 \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04781}. 
In this work, we introduce a new concept of approximate projection, which is compatible with various numerical methods for approximating exact projections. This approach is not restricted to strictly remain within the set, allowing for more flexibility in the implementation of the catching-up algorithm.
